## Overview

Fake news detection is a crucial field in combating misinformation spread across digital platforms, especially social media. It involves analyzing news content using machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning techniques to determine its authenticity. The process includes collecting datasets, preprocessing text, extracting features, and training models to classify news as real or fake. Common approaches include linguistic analysis, sentiment detection, and credibility checks using external fact-checking sources. By implementing automated fake news detection, we can enhance the reliability of online information and minimize the negative impact of misinformation on society.
